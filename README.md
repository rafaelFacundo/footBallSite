This is a personal project, I'm using it to learn front-end development with React. Until today, the site only has the front end, but I plan to implement the back end with a database in the future. But basically this is a site that shows you live games, player stats and information about all the leagues in the world.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

the site currently looks like this:
